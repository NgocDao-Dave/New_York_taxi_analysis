## Research Goal
My research goal is to analyze and predict the share of yellow taxi pickups in New York City compared to high-volume for-hire vehicles (HVFHV) using machine learning models.

## Timeline
The timeline for the data used in this project spans from November 2023 to May 2024.

## Download the Zone files from Taxi Zone Files.
Extract and place the taxi_zone files (https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/misc/taxi_zones.zip) under the data/raw/ directory.

## Running the Project

Step 1: Download_raw_data.ipynb to download and organize the raw taxi and HVFHV trip data.

Step 2: Preprocess_taxi_and_fvhfv.ipynb to clean and preprocess the taxi and HVFHV trip data.

Step 3: Preproces_external_data.ipynb to clean and preprocess external datasets, including weather and PLUTO data.

Step 4: .Preliminary_analysis_and_visualizing.ipynb to perform initial analysis and visualization of the combined dataset.

Step 5: Modelling.ipynb to train and evaluate machine learning models on the processed data.
